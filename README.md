# **Introduction ðŸ“Œ** 
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of all arrest types in Chicago for the year 2018. The task presented a challenge in identifying a measure of criminality that is inherently subjective. Unlike burglaries, assaults, and violent crimes, which are often the result of civilian reports through 911 calls, arrests predominantly depend on the discretion of police officers. Our decision to focus on arrests was driven by the recognition of systemic bias and the disproportionate policing of communities with lower incomes and minority populations. The primary aim of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying potential hotspots for future arrests in Chicago. The initial phase of model development utilized various indicators of risk, such as unlit alleyways, potholes, the prevalence of vacant buildings, and the presence of public housing projects, which were later refined to enhance the predictive accuracy of the model.
